# UITron

**Create Electron Apps with Ease**

UITron is a simple, all-in-one Python GUI tool that lets you build fully structured Electron desktop apps — no command line, no extra tools, no hassle.

---

## How to Use

### Prepare Your Web Files

1. Put all your app’s web files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, media, etc.) into a single folder.
2. You can organize your files with **subfolders** inside this folder however you like — UITron copies everything recursively.

---

### Build Your Electron App with UITron

1. Download the latest `uitron.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/noahscratch493/uitron/releases).

2. Run `uitron.exe`.

3. In the UI:

   * Click **Select Folder with Files** and pick the folder where your web files live.
   * Enter your desired **App Folder Name** — this will be the name of the folder created under `/apps/` where your app will live.
   * Enter your desired **EXE Name** — UITron renames the Electron launcher executable to this name.

4. Click **Create Electron App** — UITron will:

   * Copy the full Electron template automatically
   * Copy all your web files and subfolders into the correct location inside the app folder
   * Rename the executable to your chosen name
   * Set up everything so your app is ready to run immediately — no extra steps required!

---

### What You Get

* A fully packaged Electron app folder inside `/apps/[App Folder Name]/`
* The app’s EXE named exactly as you specified
* Your web files and all subfolders correctly bundled inside the Electron app structure
* A ready-to-run desktop app with zero command line or manual setup
